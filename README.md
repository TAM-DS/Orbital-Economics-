### 6. 💰 Orbital Economics: Markets Only Exist After Continuity is Guaranteed

**Constraint-driven economics of autonomous orbital systems**

**Key Metrics:**
- Orbital Value Stack (who captures value at each layer)
- Risk Concentration Analysis (launch vs control risk)
- Value Capture vs Failure Absorption (payoff diagram)

**Critical Findings:**

**The Orbital Value Stack:**

| Layer | Value Capture | Risk Profile |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Autonomous Control** | 92 | Infinite (every decision, forever) |
| Networking/Downlink | 60 | Moderate (visible but commoditizing) |
| Compute | 55 | Depreciating asset |
| Storage | 48 | Commodity |
| Power/Energy | 42 | Free input (after capital cost) |
| Launch | 35 | Finite (high upfront, then done) |

**The Inversion:**
```
Traditional Cloud: Compute = valuable, control = commodity
Orbital Cloud: Control = valuable, compute = commodity
```

**As you move UP the orbital stack:**
- Capital intensity DECREASES
- Risk concentration INCREASES
- Value capture INCREASES

**Launch Risk vs. Control Risk:**

**Launch:**
- High upfront (rocket could explode)
- But FINITE (once in orbit, done)
- Risk score: 55

**Control:**
- Lower per-decision
- But INFINITE (every decision, forever)
- Risk score: 92

**Control risk compounds. Launch risk doesn't.**

**Core Thesis:** Markets only exist after continuity is guaranteed.

**Insight:** 

Whoever can GUARANTEE continuity despite:
- 240ms latency
- Disconnection events
- Physical inaccessibility
- Adversarial attacks

**Owns the orbital economy.**

A loss of control cascades across compute, networking, storage, and power—destroying economic value faster than any physical component failure could.

**In orbit, control risk is existential risk.**

**Control = single point of economic fragility.**
